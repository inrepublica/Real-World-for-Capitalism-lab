Are you using any anti-virus software that runs in background? 

If so, add MOD tool EXE files "LibResDir.EXE" and "LibResXL.EXE" into your anti-virus software exception list to prevent it from blocking the tools or slow down their executions 


Run PACKALL.BAT to pack all files in all subfolders under the current MOD Kit folder into a MOD file. This will take a longer time to run but will ensure every MOD file that you have updated will be packed into the new MOD resource file. 

Run PACK.BAT to pack files under the current MOD Kit folder into a MOD file. If you update files in other subfolders (e.g. IMAGES\PERSONS folder), you should run the PACK.BAT in those folders to pack the respective files.
